# dEngine
Tried making a game engine around a year ago, based off of my 2D renderer, here is my retry!

Requirements:

* Linux
* Vim/Nano/Cat
* freeglut

How to compile:

    gcc main.c -o gameEngine -lGL -lglut
    ./gameEngine

Hamartia of my previous try:

* Memory leaks
* IOT errors
* Bad/Broken UI
  
Starting this repo empty so my progress is documented

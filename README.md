# dEngine
Tried making a game engine around a year ago, based off of my 2D renderer, here is my retry!

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DASPELLER4/dEngine/media/dEngineDocs.pdf">Documentation</a>

Requirements:

* Linux
* Vim/Nano/Cat
* freeglut
* Ncurses (for execution of the game)


Hamartia of my previous try:

* Memory leaks
* IOT errors
* Bad/Broken UI
  
Starting this repo empty so my progress is documented
